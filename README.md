Computational Physics Assignment #2

Problem #1 - Special Relativity
 This problem asks the problem to user to input the speed of a spaceship (as a fraction of c) and then print out the time in years that the spaceship takes to reach its destination as seen by both the rest frame of an observer on Earth and as perceived by a passenger on board the ship. It asks for these answers for a planet 10 years away with a speed of 0.90c, 0.98c, and 0.999c.
 
 The answers to the problem are as follows:
 
 FOR SPEED OF 0.9c
 
 Please enter the speed of the ship in terms of the speed of light (such as in, "the speed of the ship is 0.90c"):0.90. 
 Please enter the distance that the ship is traveling (in light years): 10. 
 The time it would take for a ship to travel 10.0 light years at a speed of 0.9 c as percieved by an observer is:  11.10994 years. 
 The time it would take for a ship to travel 10.0 light years at a speed of 0.9 c as percieved as a passenger on the ship is:  4.84271 years.

FOR SPEED OF 0.98c

Please enter the speed of the ship in terms of the speed of light (such as in, "the speed of the ship is 0.90c"):0.98.
Please enter the distance that the ship is traveling (in light years): 10. 
The time it would take for a ship to travel 10.0 light years at a speed of 0.98 c as percieved by an observer is:  10.203 years.
The time it would take for a ship to travel 10.0 light years at a speed of 0.98 c as percieved as a passenger on the ship is:  2.03037 years.

FOR SPEED OF 0.999c

Please enter the speed of the ship in terms of the speed of light (such as in, "the speed of the ship is 0.90c"):0.999.
Please enter the distance that the ship is traveling (in light years): 10. 
The time it would take for a ship to travel 10.0 light years at a speed of 0.999 c as percieved by an observer is:  10.00895 years.
The time it would take for a ship to travel 10.0 light years at a speed of 0.999 c as percieved as a passenger on the ship is:  0.4475 years.
 
 
Problem #2 - The semi-empirical mass formula
 This problem looks to solve the semi-empirical mass formula which calculates the approximate nuclear binding energy B of an atomic nucleus with atomic number Z and mass number A; the problem also asks for the binding energy per nucleon. The problem asks for the user to input a few different atomic nuclei. 
 
 The answers to the problems are as follows: 
 
 
 FOR A = 58, Z = 28:
 
 Please enter A: 58.
 Please enter Z: 28.
 The Binding Energy for an atomic nucleus with atomic number 28 and mass number 58 is:  490.784 MeV. 
 The binding energy per nucleon is:  8.462 MeV.
 
 
 FOR A = 59, Z = 28:
 
 Please enter A: 59. 
 Please enter Z: 28. 
 The Binding Energy for an atomic nucleus with atomic number 28 and mass number 59 is:  498.145 MeV. 
 The binding energy per nucleon is:  8.443 MeV.
 
 
 FOR A = 58, Z = 27:
 
 Please enter A: 58. 
 Please enter Z: 27. 
 The Binding Energy for an atomic nucleus with atomic number 27 and mass number 58 is:  485.309 MeV. 
 The binding energy per nucleon is:  8.367 MeV.
